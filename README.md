# haxeui-kha-extended
In your Kha project create a folder named Libraries.
Then open a terminal and write:
```
cd Libraries
git submodule add https://github.com/mundusnine/haxeui-kha-extended.git

```
If you want the FileBrowser in this repo to work or you want to use a FileSystem that works on all native and js(except Krom; testing is needed) platforms, open a terminal and write:
```
cd Libraries
git submodule add https://github.com/mundusnine/khafs.git
```
